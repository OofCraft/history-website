            Tubmans's Legacy
        </div>
        <div class="texts">
            <p>The first major acknowledgement of Tubman’s abolitionist work was by President Barrack Obama in 2013 when he named part of the Maryland Eastern Shore the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument, which was the first American Monument to honor an African American woman. In 2016, Secretary Jack Lew announced the plan to put Tubman on the front of the 20-dollar bill to honor her legacy. She freed a lot of people from slavery and helped the fight against slavery, which is literal freedom of humans. She left a lasting legacy on women’s rights and fighting for freedom which is still sometimes represented today.</p>
            <p>Tubman represented freedom in such a risky way by freeing slaves and being a spy. She worked hard almost her whole life for the freedoms and rights of African Americans and women across the country. She is still being acknowledged as locations are being named after her, and she had a major impact on freedom in this country. Tubman represented freedom of African Americans and also in her later years, women’s rights.</p>
